# Tensorflow Micropyhon Example's Prebuilt Firmware

This repository holds pre-built firmware for the Tensorflow Micropython
Examples Project.

It is separate because each image is several MB large and its not
needed in the main repository.

This is a pre-1.0.0 firmware release.

This seems to now work with the micro_speech example but a
bit more clean-up and documentation improvements are needed 
before I will release the actual version 1.0.0 release.
